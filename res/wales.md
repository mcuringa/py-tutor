# Opening OER to more students through computer supported peer tutoring


The tradition understanding of Open Ed/OER is insufficient for a robust openness. Software design coupled with interaction design plays an equal role in determining the openness of a project.

- what is open in OER?
    - FOSS
    - Ed Theory
- (software, interaction, instructional) design matters
    - support learners effectively (MOOC problem)
    - broaden who can contribute -- make it easy
        - wikipedia
        - git/github
        - test first dev/XP
    - PyTutor is design experiment in designing for open


Page 2 (katy)
----------------------
- examples of bad design
    - "formally open", but not functionally open
- general examples
    - "open" media in formats that can't be edited easily (Youtube, ebooks)
    - MOOCs don't support learners
- CodeAcademy -- inspiration and problem we're solving

-------------------
- why PyTutor is better
- flexible content
    - tags
        - easy to create "lightweight"
        - can tie into courses, instructional materials (books)
        - problem sets
        - depth/crosscut
    - be bold -- wikipedia and agile development
        - version system
        - rollbacks
        - tests
    - "flags"
- lack of collaboration features for editors
    - they can use existing tools (google group, github wiki for the project)
    - we will build when we need
        - "talk pages"
        - integrated issue tracker for questions
        - "maintainer" or tagged revisions
    - as open as possible at first


- support for learning
    - peer tutoring
        - messaging
        - help requests
        - social network backing
    - metacogntion
        - reporting
- Low-stakes, anti-surveillance
